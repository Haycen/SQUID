Description: SQuID is made to help researchers to become familiar with
    multilevel variation, and to build up sampling designs for their study. SQuID
    is built up as a series of modules that guide the user into situations of
    increasing complexity to explore the dynamics between the way records are
    collected and estimates of parameters of specific interest; The last modules
    (Module 10) is the full model simulation package that allows the user to
    generate data sets that can then be used to run analyses in the statistical
    package of their choice for specific research questions.

	p(HTML(paste0("In the <i>",Module_titles$mod3,"</i> module, we accounted for the effect of a single environmental 
		factor on phenotype. This statistical process ends up describing the organism's phenotype 
		as a line in uni-dimensional environment (the environment on the X-axis, phenotype on the Y-axis). 
		For example, parent birds typically increase the rate of food delivery to the nest as their offspring grow older. 
		We call this line a reaction norm, and in the case of parent birds, it makes adaptive sense because older 
		offspring are bigger and need a faster food intake to maintain growth."))),
	
	p('A simple reaction norm line in a uni-dimensional environment is a simplified scenario, 
		because we know organisms exist in environments that have multiple environmental factors 
		(e.g., they are multidimensional). There is increasing evidence that multiple factors 
		can influence many phenotypes. In the case of parent birds increasing food delivery to
		older offspring, maintaining the rate of increase with age over all environmental conditions 
		makes little sense. If, for example, brood size varies among nesting attempts,
		we might expect parents to respond to both nestling age and brood size. 
		For parent birds, the environment now has two dimensions, nestling age and brood size, 
		and instead of a reaction norm line, their behavioural response could be described by a 
		plane in this 2 dimensional space. This is what we have called "multi-dimensional phenotypic plasticity" 
		or MDPP, and in theory an organism could be responding to many environmental factors, 
		so they would have a reaction norm plane existing in n-dimensional environmental space. 
		It is hard for us to visualize past three dimensions, so here we will focus on the behaviour 
		of a reaction norm plane in just two environmental axes, but if you get comfortable with this, 
		it will be easier to imagine three or more environmental axes. Our general goal is to help you 
		gain some understanding of how specific parameter values in an analysis equation influence 
		shape and orientation of a reaction norm plane.'),
